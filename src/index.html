        <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
        <p>By Evan Wild</p>
        <p>
          Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world
          are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt
          for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from
          renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray
          them with such a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those
          questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of bear</h3>
        <p>
          Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small
          bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a
          baby bear (cub) from another species.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large
          and medium bears are just as at home in urban areas as they are in the
          countryside. Different habitats encourage different behaviour however,
          as you'll find out below. The below table also gives you some useful
          facts about bears.
        </p>

        <table>
          <caption>
            Summary of Bear Types and Characteristics
          </caption>
          <thead>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
        <p>
          Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other
          naturally growing ingredients. In general they will hunt for food
          themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down
          their sustenance from farms or country houses. They tend to live in
          relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
        </p>

          src="media/wild-bear.jpg"
          alt="A wild bear in its natural habitat"
        />
        <p>
          Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the
          old ways. They will hunt other urban creatures if necessary (including
          other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge from
          readily available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast
          food joints. When food has proven scarce, urban bears have even been
          known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked
          beans, ready meals, and microwave ovens.
        </p>

          src="media/urban-bear.jpg"
          alt="An urban bear scavenging in a city"
        />
        <p>
          Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks,
          to the toilets in McDonald's, to their own apartment.
        </p>

        <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
        <p>
          Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a
          mate that they can spend the rest of their lives with. They will woo a
          potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for
          example with cave paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild
          bear, and mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD in the case of an urban
          bear.

          <h3>About the author</h3>
          <p>
            Evan Wild is an unemployed plumber from Doncaster, who has been
            really "into" wildlife since childhood. He once went to Chester Zoo
            on holiday, but got ill after eating a doner kebab.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has never seen a bear, but once read a Daily Mail article about
            them, and thinks they sound cool.

                  Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry
                  guys in the woods. With their sniffing little noses and their
                  bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of
                  putting them all in a truck and driving them outta here. I run
                  a zoo, you know.
